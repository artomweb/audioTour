# AUDIO TOUR

This is a website that I host [HERE](audio.artomweb.com) which I made to host an audio tour where QR codes are used to get each audio track.

I made a working version in less than an hour.

The name of the currently playing file is stored in the mp3 file and then read by the browser.

The track names are hashed by a node script so you need to scan the QR codes to play them.
